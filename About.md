# 📌 About the Author

## Darkelf (Kevin Moore)

**Darkelf** is an active researcher and long-time tester focused on **methodology-driven evaluation**, **long-session validation**, and **behavior-based analysis** of complex systems. This background directly informs the structure, rigor, and philosophy behind **Darkelf Retro Lounge**.

Rather than prioritizing short benchmarks or surface-level results, Darkelf’s work emphasizes:
- sustained behavior over time  
- reproducibility and validation  
- explainable configuration decisions  
- identifying failure modes that only emerge during extended use  

These principles align closely with emulator accuracy testing, where correctness is defined not by peak performance, but by **consistent, stable, and faithful behavior** under real-world conditions.

## Background & Experience

Darkelf brings decades of hands-on testing experience, including:

- Professional **beta testing for the MMORPG *Neocron*** (2001–2002), focusing on gameplay stability, systemic bugs, and long-session behavior  
- **Beta testing for MuOS**, a custom firmware platform for retro gaming devices, with emphasis on compatibility, configuration safety, and sustained performance  
- Ongoing research work centered on **evaluation methodology**, **testing frameworks**, and **evidence-based analysis**

This experience shaped a strong preference for:
- rejecting “best settings” myths  
- avoiding unsafe or undocumented configuration changes  
- documenting *why* a system behaves the way it does, not just *that* it does  

---

## Research Approach

Darkelf’s approach to emulator documentation and testing is grounded in:

- Long-session testing instead of short runs  
- Multiple gameplay scenarios per title  
- Observation of timing, logic, physics, and rendering correctness  
- Cross-checking behavior against known hardware constraints  

Performance metrics such as FPS are treated as **secondary indicators**, never as sole measures of correctness.

## Philosophy

The guiding principle behind this work is simple:

> **Accuracy is defined by behavior, not by speed.**

This philosophy prioritizes:
- emulator correctness  
- stability over time  
- transparency in methodology  
- clear, reproducible documentation  

Darkelf Retro Lounge exists to provide a reliable reference for users, testers, and developers who care about **how emulation actually works**, not just how fast it appears to run.

## Scope & Intent

Darkelf Retro Lounge is:
- a documentation and research project  
- accuracy-focused and methodology-driven  
- independent and non-commercial  

It is **not**:
- a source of copyrighted game files  
- a collection of unsafe configuration presets  
- a benchmark-driven performance showcase  

All findings and tools associated with this repository are shared publicly and transparently.

If you are interested in **accurate emulation**, **long-term stability**, and **evidence-based configuration choices**, this project — and its methodology — are designed with you in mind.

# AetherSX2 — Thermals & Sustained Performance (Part 5)  
## Why Benchmarks Lie and Long Sessions Matter  
*Darkelf Retro Lounge Documentation Series*

## Overview

This document addresses one of the most overlooked aspects of mobile emulation:  
**thermal behavior and sustained performance**.

While many devices perform well in short tests, **long PlayStation 2 sessions expose thermal limits** that directly impact emulation stability.

---

## 1. Peak Performance vs Sustained Performance

Mobile CPUs and GPUs are designed to **boost aggressively for short durations**.

Benchmark scores typically reflect **peak performance**, not sustained workloads.

AetherSX2 places **continuous load on the CPU**, making sustained clock speeds far more important than brief boost frequencies.

---

## 2. Thermal Throttling Explained

As temperatures rise, mobile SoCs reduce clock speeds to prevent overheating.

This process, known as **thermal throttling**, can significantly reduce emulation performance during extended gameplay sessions.

---

## 3. How Throttling Affects Emulation

When throttling occurs, users may experience:

- Audio crackle
- Sudden slowdowns
- Frame pacing instability
- Gameplay and audio desynchronization

These issues can appear **mid-session**, even if the game initially ran smoothly.

---

## 4. Device Cooling and Chassis Design

Cooling solutions vary significantly between devices and directly affect sustained performance.

| Device Design | Sustained Performance |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Thin phone, passive cooling | Low |
| Larger phone, vapor chamber | Medium |
| Gaming phone, active cooling | High |
| Tablet / handheld | Very High |

Larger chassis and advanced cooling allow CPUs to maintain higher clocks for longer durations.

---

## 5. Practical Mitigation Strategies

To improve sustained emulation stability:

- Lower internal resolution
- Avoid aggressive speed hacks
- Use balanced, accuracy-first settings
- Limit long continuous play sessions
- Use external cooling where possible

Thermal stability should be prioritized over maximum visual fidelity.

## Key Takeaway

> **In mobile emulation, sustained performance defines the real experience — not benchmark peaks.**

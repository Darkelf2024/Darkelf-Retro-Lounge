## Notice for Non-Native English Readers

This documentation is written in technical English and assumes a minimum reading comprehension equivalent to IELTS Band 6 (or similar).

The documents prioritize precision and nuance over simplified language.  
Readers are encouraged to read carefully and consider context, qualifiers, and definitions.

### Important Clarifications

- Terms such as “should”, “recommended”, “often”, and “may” are used deliberately.  
  They indicate guidance and likelihood, not mandatory instructions.

- No setting, configuration, or recommendation in this repository is intended as a universal rule or requirement.

- Guidance is situational and applies only when specific conditions, workloads, or engine behaviors are present.

- Absence of benefit on a given device or game does not invalidate the explanation provided.

### Interpretation Responsibility

Readers are responsible for:
- understanding conditional language,
- consulting the Definitions & Terminology document,
- and recognizing that emulator behavior varies by game, device, and environment.

Misinterpretation caused by language barriers or assumption of absolute meaning is not a fault of the documentation.

This repository aims to explain behavior, not to issue prescriptive commands.
